# Tessie Tracker V2

Since there was an older Version of the Tessie Tracker with two Repos, welcome to the new Monorepo for the new all enhanced Tessie Tracker V2. More infos will come soon in this repo.

(Should this project get more complex, I will consider to seperate this Repo into API and Frontend)

This project will use the exposed API of TeslaScope to retrieve data.

## Open Tasks

### Frontend

- [ ] Create Login UI
- [ ] Add Map

### API
